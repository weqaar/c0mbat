General Introduction
====================

c0mbat is a Configuration Management tool developed with Slack.

c0mbat is short for Zero-Configuration Management and Build
Automorphic Tool.


Product
=======

c0mbat is intended for configuration management in Cloud
Infrastructures.

* Features

  1. Multi-threaded (uses multiple cores as scheduled by the OS or
     by user i.e. numa utils)

  2. Parallel deployment currently over SSH channel

  3. Application wide configuration file: c0mbat.conf

  4. APT package manager handling: install, uninstall (remove),
     update

  5. Services handling: start, stop, restart, reload

  6. Inventory and Artifacts handled seprately under dir "deploy"

        1. deploy/artifacts

        2. deploy/inventory

  7. Idempotency with deployments: keeps MD5 Hashes as deployment
     cache for each host and it's artifact relationships

        1. Filesystem hash of individual artifacts under
           deploy/artifacts

        2. Configuration hash of individual artifacts, defined in
           deploy/artifacts/artifacts.json

        3. Hashes are maintained as cache under "cache/cache.json"
           that is built after initial run

        4. In ideal situation this should be a distributed cache
           accessible over IP i.e. NoSQL DB, to allow multiple
           client's to sync

  8. Two types of deployments currently supported

     1. APT package manager based

     2. Manual

  9. Manual type deployments support Permssions, this is specified
     optionally as artifact's metadata (see
     deploy/artifacts/artifacts.json)

  10. Logging under dir "logs/"

  11. Cleanup runtime/transient data with the script "clean.sh".
      Note this cleans up the logs and cache as well.

Architectrure / Code Walk-through
=================================


Structure
---------

Code is organized in this hierarchy

[image: l1tree][image]

Code is functionally divided as packages

[image: l2tree][image]


Code re-usability
-----------------

Source code allows for easy reuse of various components

   1. All variables and objects are initailized as run-time from
      "packages/conf/configinit.py"

   2. Initialized objects are available at run-time in
      "packages/globalvars.py"

   3. Re-use is as simple as calling the desired object with
      globalvars.<object>

      1. Example: to log a debug message use -
         globalvars._stats_logger.debug("YOUR MESSAGE!")


5. Usage
========

   1. Installation instructions README.txt

   2. c0mbat provides a CLI Interface, run with: python c0mbat.py
      -h
